<output>
### Hardcoded AWS Credentials in Provider Configuration

**Risk Rating**: Critical
**Justification**: Immediate exploitable vulnerability allowing unauthorized AWS access. Credentials likely committed to version control, exposing entire AWS account.

**Finding**: File `providers.tf:5-8` contains hardcoded AWS access keys and secret keys in plain text.

**Impact**: 
- Full AWS account compromise if credentials are valid
- Potential data breach, resource manipulation, or account takeover
- Credentials exposed in git history even after removal
- Violates CIS AWS Benchmark 1.12 (Ensure credentials unused for 90 days are disabled)

**Recommendation**: 
1. **Immediately rotate exposed credentials** via AWS IAM Console
2. Remove hardcoded credentials from code
3. Use one of these secure alternatives:
   - AWS IAM roles (recommended for EC2/ECS/Lambda)
   - AWS SSO for human users
   - Environment variables for CI/CD pipelines
   - AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store for application secrets

**Code Example**:
```hcl
# Before (CRITICAL VULNERABILITY)
provider "aws" {
  region     = "us-east-1"
  access_key = "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE"
  secret_key = "wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY"
}

# After (SECURE - Uses IAM Role or Environment Variables)
provider "aws" {
  region = var.aws_region
  # Credentials automatically from:
  # - IAM instance profile (if running on EC2)
  # - Environment variables (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY)
  # - AWS SSO credentials
  # - ~/.aws/credentials file
}

# For CI/CD, set environment variables:
# export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="<from-secrets-manager>"
# export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="<from-secrets-manager>"
```

**Effort**: Low (5 minutes to remove + rotate, 15 minutes to configure IAM role)

```hcl
# storage.tf:12
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "data" {
  bucket = "company-sensitive-data"
  acl    = "public-read"
}
```
</input>

<thinking>
Security Domain: Data Protection + Network Security
- S3 bucket with public-read ACL
- Bucket name suggests sensitive data
- No encryption configuration visible
- Violates AWS Well-Architected Security Pillar
- Risk: Critical - public data exposure
</thinking>

<output>
### Publicly Accessible S3 Bucket with Sensitive Data

**Risk Rating**: Critical
**Justification**: S3 bucket containing potentially sensitive data is publicly accessible. Anyone on the internet can read/download all objects, leading to immediate data breach.

**Finding**: File `storage.tf:12-15` configures S3 bucket with `acl = "public-read"` for bucket named "company-sensitive-data".

**Impact**:
- Complete exposure of sensitive data to public internet
- Regulatory compliance violations (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2)
- Reputational damage and potential legal liability
- Data exfiltration by malicious actors
- Possible ransomware targeting exposed data

**Recommendation**:
1. **Immediately remove public ACL** and apply bucket-level block public access
2. Enable S3 bucket encryption at rest (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS)
3. Enable server access logging for audit trail
4. Implement least-privilege IAM policies for bucket access
5. Consider S3 Object Lock for immutable data protection

**Code Example**:
```hcl
# Before (CRITICAL VULNERABILITY)
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "data" {
  bucket = "company-sensitive-data"
  acl    = "public-read"  # ❌ EXPOSES ALL DATA PUBLICLY
}

# After (SECURE)
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "data" {
  bucket = "company-sensitive-data"
  # No ACL specified - defaults to private
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block" "data" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.data.id

  block_public_acls       = true
  block_public_policy     = true
  ignore_public_acls      = true
  restrict_public_buckets = true
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_server_side_encryption_configuration" "data" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.data.id

  rule {
    apply_server_side_encryption_by_default {
      sse_algorithm = "AES256"  # or "aws:kms" for KMS encryption
    }
  }
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_versioning" "data" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.data.id
  versioning_configuration {
    status = "Enabled"
  }
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_logging" "data" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.data.id

  target_bucket = aws_s3_bucket.logs.id
  target_prefix = "s3-access-logs/"
}
```

    Statement = [{

      Action   = "*"
      Resource = "*"
    }]
  })
}
```
</input>

<thinking>
Security Domain: IAM
- IAM policy grants full permissions to all AWS services
- Violates least privilege principle
- High risk of lateral movement if compromised
- Risk: High - overly permissive access
</thinking>

<output>
### Overly Permissive IAM Policy - Wildcard Permissions

**Risk Rating**: High
**Justification**: IAM policy grants unrestricted access (`*:*`) to all AWS services and resources, violating least privilege principle. If credentials are compromised, attacker has full AWS account access.

**Finding**: File `iam.tf:20-30` defines IAM policy with `Action = "*"` and `Resource = "*"`, granting administrator-level permissions.

**Impact**:
- Complete account takeover if credentials compromised
- No audit trail of intended vs. actual permissions
- Compliance violations (SOC 2, ISO 27001)
- Lateral movement risk across AWS services
- Accidental resource deletion or misconfiguration

**Recommendation**:
1. Replace wildcard permissions with specific actions needed by application
2. Use separate policies for different service access (S3, DynamoDB, etc.)
3. Apply resource-level permissions where possible
4. Use IAM Access Analyzer to identify unused permissions
5. Implement condition keys for additional constraints (source IP, MFA, time)

**Code Example**:
```hcl
# Before (HIGH RISK)
resource "aws_iam_policy" "app_policy" {
  name = "application-policy"
  
  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [{
      Effect   = "Allow"
      Action   = "*"          # ❌ GRANTS ALL PERMISSIONS
      Resource = "*"          # ❌ TO ALL RESOURCES
    }]
  })
}

# After (LEAST PRIVILEGE)
resource "aws_iam_policy" "app_policy" {
  name = "application-policy"
  
  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Sid    = "S3ReadWriteSpecificBucket"
        Effect = "Allow"
        Action = [
          "s3:GetObject",
          "s3:PutObject",
          "s3:DeleteObject"
        ]
        Resource = [
          "arn:aws:s3:::my-app-bucket/*"
        ]
      },
      {
        Sid    = "DynamoDBReadWrite"
        Effect = "Allow"
        Action = [
          "dynamodb:GetItem",
          "dynamodb:PutItem",
          "dynamodb:UpdateItem",
          "dynamodb:Query"
        ]
        Resource = [
          "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-1:123456789012:table/my-app-table"
        ]
      }
    ]
  })
}

<special_considerations>
**Dev/Test**: May have relaxed security; still requires justification. No prod data/creds. Use separate AWS accounts.
**Legacy**: Document constraints, provide incremental path, prioritize highest-risk.
**Cost**: Acknowledge significant costs, offer alternatives, never compromise Critical/High for cost.
**Team Skill**: Provide context, link tutorials, suggest AWS Support for complex cases.
