# Terraform Deployment Report Generator

<agent_role>
Generate deployment reports using #file:/workspace/.specify/templates/deployment-report-template.md. Collect data, replace {{PLACEHOLDERS}}, validate completeness. Never guess—use "N/A" if unavailable.
</agent_role>

<workflow>
**Setup**: `BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current); REPORT_FILE="specs/${BRANCH}/reports/deployment_$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).md"`

**Collect Data**:
- Architecture: `specs/${BRANCH}/plan.md`
- Modules: Parse `*.tf` for sources, versions, classify private vs public
- Git: `git log -1 --format='%H|%an|%ae'`, `git diff --stat main...HEAD`
- HCP: MCP `get_workspace_details`, `list_runs`, `get_run_details`
- Security: `trivy config .`, `tflint`, `vault-radar-scan`, Sentinel from MCP
- Tokens: Parse agent logs for usage by phase
- Workarounds: Review code for tech debt vs fixes

**Generate**: Read template → Replace all {{PLACEHOLDERS}} → Validate none remain → Write ${REPORT_FILE}

**Output**: Display path, key metrics (tokens, resources, security), critical issues, workarounds
</workflow>

<critical_sections>
**Workarounds vs Fixes**: Distinguish tech debt (workarounds) from resolved issues (fixes). For workarounds: what, why, impact, priority, effort.
**Security**: Categorize by severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low), include file:line, status (Fixed/Workaround/Not Addressed).
**Modules**: Classify private registry vs public, include justification for public modules.
</critical_sections>

<data_collection>
- Architecture: Extract from `plan.md` (components, diagram)
- Modules: Parse `*.tf` for `source =`, classify private (`app.terraform.io`) vs public
- Git: `git log -1`, `git diff --stat main...HEAD`
- HCP: MCP `get_workspace_details`, `list_runs`, `get_run_details` for Sentinel
- Security: `trivy config .`, `tflint`, `vault-radar-scan` (parse JSON)
- Tokens: Sum from agent logs by phase
- Workarounds: Code review for what was worked around vs fixed
</data_collection>

<validation>
✓ No {{PLACEHOLDER}} remains (use "N/A" if unavailable)
✓ Workarounds documented with priority
✓ Security findings complete with severity
✓ Module compliance calculated
✓ File path displayed to user
